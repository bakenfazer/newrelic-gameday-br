### Extra Credit

# Instructions:

Great job completing all of the questions! For those of you who have additional time, try to answer as many of the extra credit questions as you can!

# Challenge

1. We've been getting a lot of complaints about links being broken on the site. Set up New Relic synthetic monitoring so that the site will be crawled for broken links. Create an alert to notify the team any time the monitor finds a broken link.  
2. Within the User Interface, create a grouping of all entities related to this demo application so that your team can quickly and easily gauge the overall health and performance of the stack at a glance. 
3. Recommendation Service is throwing an error. Using the k8s cluster explorer, provide the start time for when that service started running. 
4. Our automated service map doesn't seem to be working. Using the Observability Maps App, create a custom Observability Map. Reference the screenshot below:

5. Install a New Relic I/O package to the account. Bonus points if it is related to the microservices app we're using!
