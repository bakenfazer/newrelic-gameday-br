# Challenge

The team thinks they've seen this before with an error called "HardToSeeError", but they need more information. Using New Relic's Distributed Tracing feature, report the error.group.message for this error so that you can quickly and easily confirm the root cause.

# Free Hint

Navigate to the APM view for the "gcp-boutique-frontend" service, seems to be happening on /cart POST requests.
