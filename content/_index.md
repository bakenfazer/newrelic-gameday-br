### Welcome to the New Relic Partner Gameday!

# Overview

Today, we will be breaking off into teams and diagnosing website performance issues using New Relic. 

# Agenda

Each team will be presented with a total of 10 issues to diagnose using various features of the New Relic platform including:

* APM
* Distributed Tracing
* Logs
* Alerts 
* Real User Monitoring
* Dashboards
* Apps

You will have approximately 20 minutes for each issue.  Once you have dignosed the issue, enter your findings into the form provided by your Relic host, and then feel free to move on to the next issue.

Good luck, and may the best team win!
